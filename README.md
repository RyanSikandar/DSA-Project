# DSA-Project
End Semester Project for DSA:
A search engine that takes inspiration from Google.

Currenlty, all the articles of the dataset have been added to a single json file and the ids of the articles have been changed from the original 'source-date-title' ids to integral numbers ranging from 1 to the total number of articles. This would help in making indexing simpler.

Moreover, preprocessing has been done to a significant extent as well.
